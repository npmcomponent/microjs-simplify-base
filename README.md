Simplify.js is a high-performance JavaScript 2D/3D polyline simplification library by Vladimir Agafonkin, extracted from [Leaflet](http://leaflet.cloudmade.com/).

This repository is just base code for the actual simplify JS libraries:

 - [microjs/simplify-2D](https://github.com/microjs/simplify-2D) - Use this for 2D line simplification.
 - [microjs/simplify-3D](https://github.com/microjs/simplify-3D) - Use this for 3D line simplification.
 - [microjs/simplify](https://github.com/microjs/simplify) - Use this only if you need 2D and 3D line simplification.
